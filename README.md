To modify the ConfigValidator to support validating a hierarchical list of configuration files, where each configuration file can override or extend the settings defined by its predecessors, you can adjust the initialization to accept a list of configuration paths. This approach allows the validator to merge configurations, giving precedence to the last file in the list for any overlapping settings. This feature is useful for managing configurations across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) or for layering configuration files for different modules or components.


This version of ConfigValidator initializes with a list of configuration file paths (config_paths) instead of a single path. The merge_configs method loads each file in the list and updates a merged configuration dictionary, which effectively combines all configurations, with later entries in the list overriding earlier ones if there are duplicate keys. This merged configuration is then used for validation against the metadata configuration as before.

This approach offers flexibility in managing configurations, allowing for a base configuration to be extended or overridden by additional files. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to separate common configurations from environment-specific settings or modular configurations.



To incorporate log management into the ConfigValidator class, we can use Python's built-in logging module. This allows us to log information, warnings, and errors throughout the validation process, which can be helpful for debugging and keeping track of the validator's operations. Here's how you could integrate logging into the class:

Import the logging module: This is necessary to set up and use logging.
Configure the logger: You can configure the logger at the beginning of your script or within the class. This configuration specifies the log level, format, and where to output logs (e.g., console, file).
Use logging statements: Throughout your class methods, use logging statements to log messages of various severity levels (e.g., info, warning, error).

This setup uses basic logging configuration with messages outputted to the console, including timestamps, log levels, and messages. You can further customize the logging (e.g., log to a file, change the log format, or set a different log level) by adjusting the basicConfig parameters. This enhancement improves the usability of the ConfigValidator by providing insights into its operation and any issues encountered during the validation process.
